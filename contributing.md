# Contributing

Thanks for taking the time to contribute. This project aims to keep contribution overhead low and expectations clear.

## Pull Requests

### PR Title Prefixes
Use one of the following prefixes in the PR title:

- `feat:` — new features  
- `fix:` — bug fixes  
- `chore:` — maintenance, refactors, or non-feature changes  

Examples:  
`feat: add support for TSXXXX error`
`fix: correct wording for suggestion and help text for TS2322`
`chore: refactor message_parser`
`chore: add linting rules for unwrap usage`

### Issues & Linking

- **If your PR fixes an issue**:  
  Include `Fixes #<issue-number>` in the description so we can track and close the issue.

- **If your PR relates to an issue but does not fix it**:  
  Link the issue with `Related to #<issue-number>` or something similar for context.

- **If your PR is not tied to an issue**:  
  No need to open one. A standalone PR is completely fine. Just make sure to provide context on the PR.

## Code Expectations

- Keep changes focused and avoid unrelated edits unless trivial.
- Add or update tests where it makes sense, we are relatively flexible with tests - if something is complex add a test.

## Review Process

- Not all PRs will be handled the same. Some may be prioritized, others may be delayed, and a few may be rejected for any reasonable reason (scope, direction, complexity, etc.).  
  We aim to keep rejections minimal and provide clear explanations when they occur.

## Communication

- Feel free to open a **draft PR** and ask for early feedback.
